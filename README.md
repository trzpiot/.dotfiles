[![Nix Flake](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nix%20Flake-%235277C3?logo=snowflake)](https://nix.dev/concepts/flakes.html)

These are my personal dotfiles. 🔧 Managed with Nix. ❄️

I try to keep them always up to date (e.g. with the modern tools [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) and [Snowfall Lib](https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib)).
If you have any questions about Nix or NixOS, feel free to create an issue or contact the amazing [community](https://nixos.org/community/).

> I am constantly changing my dotfiles. Use the code or the flake at your own risk.
