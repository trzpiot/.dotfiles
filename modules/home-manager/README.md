## Packages

All packages can be found on [NixOS Search - Packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages) for more information.
Note that I am using the unstable channel by default.

Applications with additional configurations end up in a directory ([programs](programs)) specifically for the application. All others are simply defined in the [default.nix](default.nix).

## Theme

![](../../assets/dracula.png)

I always try to use [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) as a theme where possible and available.
It's the best theme in my opinion as it's available for hundreds of applications.
And it's just beautiful, so colorful! ðŸ¤©
